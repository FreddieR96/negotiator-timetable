A web page for finding the commuting distance between points in London.

Simply click on points on the map, up to 10 points, then specify the time spent at each point (defaults to 30), and calculate journey times.

Enclosed with a square of coordinates to stop points which are wildly not London.

Most code is in assets/application.js and main#getResults controller and main#home view.
